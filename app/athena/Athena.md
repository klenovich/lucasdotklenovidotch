Athena

React Native developement for an unreleased AI health application. Frontend TypeScript development in React Native / React / Expo.

Athena is an unreleased mobile/web application providing personalized causal health suggestions to users based off of machine-learning insights to user provided data. 

I was asked to contribute mostly to the front-end development of the application by a member of the team I worked alongside at Politeia. 

I worked on the development of the mobile and web application in Expo / React Native / React using TypeScript / JavaScript. 




Around late summer / fall 2023 I was asked by a previous colleague I had worked alongside at Politeia about contributing to a current project he had been working on called Athena. Athena would provide personalized causal health suggestions to users based off of machine-learning insights to user provided data and connected sources. A proof of concept had been built for the backend and help was needed to contribute to the frontend development of the app.

I worked part time on building out the frontend portion of the app in TypeScript using React Native / React / Expo. Started with conceptual design work of the UI/UX to best suit the concept and expected flow of the application. Built out the individual React components in TypeScript / CSS. Finished with a working proof of concept that interacted with the backend. Unfortunately the project was put on hold and is yet to be released.
